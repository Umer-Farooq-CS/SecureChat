# File: certs/.keep
# Purpose: Directory placeholder for certificates and private keys
# ================================================================================
#
# Description:
#     This directory stores certificates and private keys generated by
#     scripts/gen_ca.py and scripts/gen_cert.py. These files are gitignored
#     and should NEVER be committed to version control.
#
# Expected Files:
#     - ca-key.pem: CA private key (generated by scripts/gen_ca.py)
#     - ca-cert.pem: CA certificate (generated by scripts/gen_ca.py)
#     - server-key.pem: Server private key (generated by scripts/gen_cert.py)
#     - server-cert.pem: Server certificate (generated by scripts/gen_cert.py)
#     - client-key.pem: Client private key (generated by scripts/gen_cert.py)
#     - client-cert.pem: Client certificate (generated by scripts/gen_cert.py)
#
# Links to Other Files:
#     - scripts/gen_ca.py: Generates CA key and certificate in this directory
#     - scripts/gen_cert.py: Generates server/client certificates in this directory
#     - app/crypto/pki.py: Loads certificates from this directory
#     - app/client.py: Loads client certificate from this directory
#     - app/server.py: Loads server certificate from this directory
#     - .gitignore: This directory is gitignored
#
# Result:
#     - Provides secure storage for certificates and keys
#     - Prevents accidental commit of sensitive files
#     - Organizes certificate files in one location
